# Senior Design

The whole program runs from `main.py`.

### Drive base
 - Sets motor speed using PWM
### Intake
- Turns motors on and off with predefined speed (PWM)
### Sorting
- Computer vision to photograph, analyze, and return color of ball
- Upper servo motor (#1) moves upper disc to move one ball at a time into sorting and dropoff positions; has 90 degrees of motion
- Lower servo (#2) moves sorting arm to drop balls into color bins
### Launching 
- Release launching carriage block by retracting linear actuator
### Weightlifting
- Actuates servo motor to rotate 90 degrees, releasing towed wagon subsystem
