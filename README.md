# Senior-Design

# Code base for the following actions:
# Drive base: Change motor speed using PWM to increase and decrease motor RPM
# Intake: Turn motors on and off with set speed using PWM
# Sorting: Computer vision to recognize color of ball, PWM with servo motors to align slide and move ball
# servo motor 1 will have 90 degrees of motion, servo 2 motion will be dictated based on loaction of ball holders
# Launching: Release linear actuator 
# Weightlifting: Actuate servo motor to rotate 90 degrees
